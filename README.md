In this project, I have scrapped the Snapdeal E-commerce website product price and it tracks the product price. An email alert will be sent to the user when ever the price of the product is low (upon providing price threshold).I Used google 2 step verification for email password which makes the application more secure. User can save his money and time by tracking the price by an email alert that he/she wished to purchase. I have used Python to track the product prices from the website and libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests. BeautifulSoup enables us to extract data and parse  HTML and XML documents.

Email Alert sent to user:
